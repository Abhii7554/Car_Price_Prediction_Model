# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

**One-line summary:** Predict the selling price of used cars using features such as brand, car age, fuel type, transmission, kilometers driven, and previous owners.

## Project Overview
This project trains machine learning models to predict the selling price of a used car (in lakhs) using a dataset of car listings. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training (Linear Regression and Random Forest), evaluation, and saving the best model for reuse.
